# Dynamic Occlusion With Terrain
Dynamic occlusion refers to the technique used in Unity to determine how objects within the field of view obstruct each other and whether these objects should be rendered. It is employed to enhance game performance by preventing unnecessary rendering processes. The system dynamically calculates and manages the visibility of objects based on their occlusion, ensuring that only the relevant and visible elements are rendered, thus optimizing the rendering pipeline and improving overall gameplay efficiency.

#  Level of Detail (LOD) System
The Level of Detail (LOD) System in Unity is a technique that involves rendering objects at different levels of detail based on their distance and viewing angle. This system is designed to enhance performance by displaying distant objects with lower detail levels and transitioning to higher detail levels as the objects get closer. By dynamically adjusting the level of detail, Unity's LOD System optimizes rendering efficiency, ensuring that resources are allocated appropriately to improve overall game performance.
